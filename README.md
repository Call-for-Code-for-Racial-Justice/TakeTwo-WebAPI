# Take Two API

### Emb(race): Diverse Representation: Problem Statement

*Bias is learned and perpetuated in different ways (e.g. societal beliefs, misrepresentation, ignorance) that consequently create inequitable outcomes across all spheres of life.*

### Description of Take Two API

This API is part of the Call For Code Take Two project. This API is used to capture the data crowdsourced by our contributors through the [Take 2 Chrome extension tool](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/taketwo-marker-chromeextension).

The API is used to fetch the defined categories of racial bias and serve them in the extension tool. It also captures the data highlighted by contributors and posts it to a backend database. This data is used to train an [ML model](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/taketwo-datascience) that can detect racial bias. 


### Architecture

This API (highlighted in the following diagram) is part of the Call For Code Take Two MVP 1 delivery. This API is used to capture the data highlighted by users through the Take 2 Chrome extension tool.
