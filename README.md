# Take 2 API

This API is part of the Call For Code Take Two MVP 1 delivery. This API is used to capture the data highlighted by users through the Take 2 Chrome extension tool. 

The highlighted and categorised text is sent to a backend cloudant database, which is then used by the data science stream of this project.
